[[include:includes/match/match.md]]

When needed custom expressions can be written into a task using the `match` option.  
`match` follows the inteface [IMatchOpt](/build-include/interfaces/src_interface.imatchopt.html).
Any omitted values are included from the values of default match [MatchBuildInclude](/build-include/classes/src_matchoptions.matchbuildinclude.html)  
It is also possible to merge current [matches](/build-include/enums/enums.regexkind.html) with new values.
